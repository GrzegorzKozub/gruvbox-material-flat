# Gruvbox Material Flat

Gruvbox theme with Material palette and flat appearance

## Tasks

- [ ] Come up with a limited set of background and foreground shades
- [ ] Decide if hover and active should use `fg` instead `fg0`
- [ ] Solve selection and highlight color collision
- [ ] Remove the border around the active UI elements navigated to using the keyboard
- [ ] Simplify the syntax colors, possibly based on the built in Modern theme

## Red color

`#ff0000` is used when the effects of changing a specific property were not observed
